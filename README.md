# Voice-Assistant
A voice assistant to do all your work on desktop.
Create a folder UserIdentification to store images of all the users. Keep the folder and the 2 python files in same folder.
If you want to run with cmd, go to that folder and run Harsha.py.
Whenever you run the file Harsha.py, the webcam takes a photo of the person or persons infront of it and compares with the images in folder.
Only those users whose images are present will be granted access and the voice assistant tells "Access Denied" and quits for the others.

Once access is granted, you can open any file, play songs and movies, search for something in google or youtube,find weather info, book travelling tickets, movie tickets, news, opens maps, shows location of a place and navigation while driving, reminder/notification for every 15 minutes and 1 hour, write an email....
If the query is not found, it searches in google.
You can open any microsoft application mentioned in the program.(all the commonly used programs are mentioned)
If you want to add any other folders or applications to open, follow the same model: write path to the folder and for the .exe file.
Say quit or kill yourself or exit or see you soon to close the application.
